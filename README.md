## Description <a id="description"></a>

_A queryable API using RESTful principles that shares data about the plants and appropriate places to plant them of the garden of Instagramâ€™s [@neojurassicpdx](https://www.instagram.com/neojurassicpdx/) - a pseudo tropical Pacific Northwest garden with an emphasis on foliage - 217 different flora, over 1000 plants and trees.  A React webpage that displays and allows the user to search the APIs data._

# Monday, February 28, 2022 - 1 hour (9 total)

* 8pm-9pm Begin building sample API using Firestore, Firebase, Node.js, Express middleware, and Typescript - [See commit history of the sample API's repo](https://github.com/jessicarubinwilliams/ebenezer-don-practice-api/commits/main) - set up project, created and tested in Postman basic helloWorld function to test API set up and link to firebase & firestore

# Tuesday, March 1, 2022 - 6 hours (15 total)

* 10am-11am Continue working on building sample API sample API using Firestore, Firebase, Node.js, Express middleware, and Typescript - [See commit history of the sample API's repo](https://github.com/jessicarubinwilliams/ebenezer-don-practice-api/commits/main) - research and experiment with how to configure Firebase Functions using .env as well as ES6 import statements. Eventually used require statement because it worked and that's what the Firebase documentation shows. Cobbled together something that works using multiple resources. [Firebase Admin SDK Docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup), [Firebase Environment Configuratin Docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/config-env), & ["Configuring Firebase Admin SDK with Express"](https://medium.com/@tanya/configuring-firebase-admin-sdk-with-express-931b02ee2f91) Medium article.

* 7:30pm-8pm Continue working on building sample API sample API using Firestore, Firebase, Node.js, Express middleware, and Typescript - [See commit history of the sample API's repo](https://github.com/jessicarubinwilliams/ebenezer-don-practice-api/commits/main) - Add & deploy 400 error handling - user error
* 8pm-8:30pm Research user authentication with Firebase 9. Most helpful resource I found: [Handling user authentication with Firebase](https://blog.logrocket.com/user-authentication-firebase-react-apps/)
* 8:30pm-9pm Create and link [new repo](https://github.com/jessicarubinwilliams/firebase-practice-api-2) & Firebase project for a second practice API. Needing to deploy feature branches to Firestore makes feature branch development less helpful than a new repo at this point.
