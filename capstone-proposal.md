# _neojurassicpdx: An Epicodus Capstone Proposal_
#### _By **Jessica R. Williams**_

## _Project's Purpose or Goal:_ 

_A queryable API using RESTful principles that shares data about the plants and appropriate places to plant them of the garden of Instagramâ€™s [@neojurassicpdx](https://www.instagram.com/neojurassicpdx/) - a pseudo tropical Pacific Northwest garden with an emphasis on foliage - 217 different flora, over 1000 plants and trees.  A React webpage that displays and allows the user to search the APIs data._

## _List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:_

* _A full CRUD API of plant listings_
* _A web-based front-end UI for querying the API and displaying the results_

What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.

* _Firebase, Cloud Firestore, Express and Node.js for the API_
* _React for the UI_

If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.

* _Deploying both the API & the UI_
* _Swagger-Based Documentation for the API_
* _a navbar in the API_
* _search box in the navbar_ 
* _add images to the API_ 
* _render images from the API in the UI_
* _Token-based user authentication and authorization for CUD functionality of the API_
* _Enable CORS for the API_
* _user authorization and authentication for both the UI:_
1. _user accounts for saving "favorited" plants_
2. _admin accounts for web-based interface for create, update and delete functionality of the API_
3. _limited user access to updating sources for obtaining each plant_
4. _Add functionality for a user to submit requests to the admins for corrections or additions to the database_ 

What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?
