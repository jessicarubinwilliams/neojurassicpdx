# _neojurassicpdx: An Epicodus Capstone Proposal_
#### _By **Jessica R. Williams**_

## _Project's Purpose or Goal:_ 

_A queryable API using RESTful principles that shares data about the plants and appropriate places to plant them of the garden of Instagramâ€™s [@neojurassicpdx](https://www.instagram.com/neojurassicpdx/) - a pseudo tropical Pacific Northwest garden with an emphasis on foliage - 217 different flora, over 1000 plants and trees.  A React webpage that displays and allows the user to search the APIs data._

## _List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:_

* _A full CRUD API of plant listings_

## _What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific._

* _Typescript, Firebase, Cloud Firestore, Express and Node.js for the API_

## _If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific._

* _A web-based React front-end UI for querying the API and displaying the results (Read functionality)_
* _A web-based React front-end UI for Create, Update, Delete functionality of the API_
* _Deploying both the API & the UI_
* _Add @neojurassic's Instagram feed to the UI (with Marc's permission)_
* _Get fancier with the UI styling_
* _Swagger-based documentation for the API_
* _a navbar in the UI_
* _search box in the navbar_ 
* _add images to the API_ 
* _render images from the API in the UI_
* _Token-based user authentication and authorization for CUD functionality of the API (Read will not require this)_
* _Enable CORS for the API_
* _user authorization and authentication for both the UI and the API:_
    - _user accounts for saving "favorited" plants_
    - _admin accounts for web-based interface for create, update and delete functionality of the API_
    - _limited user access to updating sources for obtaining each plant_
    - _Add functionality for a user to submit requests to the admins for corrections or additions to the database_ 

## _What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?_

* _Additional Firebase Cloud functionality_
* _Bootstrap_
* _Swagger_
